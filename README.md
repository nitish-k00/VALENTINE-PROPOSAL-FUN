# VALENTINE-PROPOSAL-FUN

A fun and interactive React app developed for my friend to propose to his girlfriend. The app features a proposal interaction where the "Accept" and "Reject" buttons are dynamically resized based on user interaction. Upon accepting the proposal, a "Pookie" photo is displayed as a final gesture.

## Features
- "Accept" and "Reject" buttons with dynamic resizing.
- "Reject" button makes the "Accept" button grow, and the "Reject" button shrink.
- A "Pookie" photo is displayed after the proposal is accepted.
